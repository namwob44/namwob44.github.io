<p>The research goals of this lab are to take a system’s level view of teleoperation to improve the robustness of assistive robotics and prosthetics. The modules we explore are human intent inferencing, autonomous robotic policies, and shared control to mix human and robot policies.<img src="/imgs/Main_figure.pdf" alt="" style="float: middle" /></p>

<p>Toward this pursuit, we break this down into a few main questions:
	1) How can we accurately determine a human’s intent?
	2) How do we develop optimal policies given intent inference?
	3) How do we design shared control strategies that operator’s prefer?</p>

<p>To address these questions we primarily focus on <b>optimal control strategies</b> including both Model-based (Model Predictive Control and Sequential Action Control) and Model-free (Reinforcement Learning and Active Learning) approaches, <b>data-driven methods</b> (Neural Networks, SVM, Bayesian Networks, Koopman Operators, Optimal Transport), and <b>multi-objective optimization</b> strategies (multi-label classification, genetic algorithms, and fuzzy logic).</p>

<p>While the core of our research focus on assistive robotics, we also extend these techniques to other applications such as additive manufacturing and bioinformatics.</p>

<p>Feel free to explore the site with lots of different videos, projects, guides, tutorials, and lectures to get started in robotics!</p>
