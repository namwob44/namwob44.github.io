<h2 id="research-focus">Research Focus</h2>
<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher specializing in the study of shared control between humans and robots for telemanipulation. Specifically, I have an expertise in <b>optimal control strategies</b> including both Model-based (Model Predictive Control and Sequential Action Control) and Model-free (Reinforcement Learning and Active Learning) approaches, <b>data-driven methods</b> (Neural Networks, SVM, Bayesian Networks, Koopman Operators), and <b>multi-objective optimization strategies</b> (multi-label classification, genetic algorithms, and fuzzy logic). These efforts have focused on 1) determining the human’s intent inference, 2) developing an optimal grasp goal for the robot based on the intent inference, and 3) designing control strategies to aid in appropriately grasping objects in a manner the operator prefers.</p>
