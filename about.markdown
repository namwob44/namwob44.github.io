![ ](/imgs/mibowman2.jpg){: style="float: right"} My name is Michael Bowman. I am a postdoctoral Researcher at University of Pennsylvania in the Cancer Biology department. Currently, I have decided to shift fields for a short time to gain a better understanding of genetics, evolution, and biological systems to bring these back to robotic systems and teaming.



I received B.S. degrees in both Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering from Colorado School of Mines in 2017. Following, I received a PhD within the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Colorado School of Mines in 2023. My background is in robotics specifically I have worked on human-robot interaction for telemanipulation on a system level for real-time control. This includes using haptic devices, eye-gaze, and hands-free strategies through vision-based systems.



My goals with this website is to demistify the system level control, current research trends for robotic devices and how they interact with users.
