My core philosophy towards assistive robotics is *the best assistance is not noticed by the users.* Some of the most beneficial devices in everyday life reflect this principle from power-steering, , or .

To achieve this seemless assistance for robotic devices designers require 1) understanding of human intentions, 2) flexible control policies to achieve the goal in a way the operator prefers, 3) transparency and legibility so the operator knows what to expect.

Towards this never ending pursuit, here are some projects from the past.


[Intent Inference]()

[Intent Inference Control]()

[Arbitration Shared Control]()

[Filter-based Shared Control]()

[Autonomous navigation]()


[Grasping and Object Tracing]()
