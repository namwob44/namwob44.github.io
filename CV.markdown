## Research Focus
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Cancer Biology Department in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and my research focuses on intent inferencing and controls for multiagent dynamical systems. My primary background specializes in the study of shared control between humans and robots for telemanipulation. However, the techniques used in my PhD studies are universal for other dynamical systems, and the aim of my postdoctoral research is to deploy these machine learning techniques in the context of clonal evolution. Specifically, I have an expertise in <b>optimal control strategies</b> including both Model-based (Model Predictive Control and Sequential Action Control) and Model-free (Reinforcement Learning and Active Learning) approaches, <b>data-driven methods</b> (Neural Networks, SVM, Bayesian Networks, Koopman Operators), and <b>multi-objective optimization strategies</b> (multi-label classification, genetic algorithms, and fuzzy logic). These efforts have focused on inferring an agent’s current state, intended goal, and preferred actions to reach their goal. Within robotics, these efforts have focused on 1) determining the human’s intent inference, 2) developing an optimal grasp goal for the robot based on the intent inference, and 3) designing control strategies to aid in appropriately grasping objects in a manner the operator prefers. Biological systems are a keen area of interest to model as intent inference problems as they are uniquely sparse and inherently unstable, yet still hold predictable outcomes. The aim of deploying computational inferencing methods for clonal evolution is to generate testable hypotheses that allow experimental perturbations on the system. These perturbations are then used to provide further insights on the underlying mechanisms driving disease progression.
