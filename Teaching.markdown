The core teaching philosophy I hold is to have project oriented learning. Continuously trying new projects or refining old ones allow for better connection between theory and observations of actual practical systems. 

Hands-on strategies allow students to experience the iterative nature in many design projects they are likely to experience in their career. Further, it allows for deliberate practice so they can gain mastery of technical skills which in turn improve self-efficacy and self-confidence to continue exploring robotics!
